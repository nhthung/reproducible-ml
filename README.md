# Project 4

Reproducing and improving baselines of a machine learning paper.
We use the MR and SST-2 binary datasets to compare our models with those from the _Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification_ [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf) by Yoon Kim.

See `requirements.txt` for require packages.

## Models

We improve upon the Naive Bayes SVM, Linear SVM and CNN models.

Run `src/train_models.py` to train the Linear SVM and NB-SVM, run `src/cnn.py` to train CNN.
